# 🧭 Tarangini Code Quest: Treasure Hunt Round

Welcome to the **second round** of our **flagship coding event** conducted by the **Programming and Coding Club (PCC)** during the annual fest **Tarangini** at *Government Engineering College, Ajmer*.

This round isn't just coding — it's **adventure meets algorithms**.  
Each problem solved unlocks a **clue** — a digital breadcrumb — to the next challenge.  
Crack the logic, follow the trail, and reach the final treasure.
